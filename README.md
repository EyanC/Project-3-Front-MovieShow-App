Obstacles:

    I shockingly forgot to include the export default, which causes the code not to work and a lot of frustration for a simple error and spelling. 
    
    Linking the video/preview link to each individual card was a big obstacle. The code was missing in the value={movie.trailer} after the {handchange}.

    Styling the cards was challenging, since it was part of bootstrap, but I was able to manipulate the code enough to manipulate what I wanted to style differently. 


WINS

    I figured out how to make the link/trailer link to work, so that it would open the movie clip when pressing the link! 

    I was able to style everything that I wanted to change.

    I was able to add the carousel, style, and place it in the desired location with the Fantastic add movie bar.

    I was able to, with help from peers to style my header and title to fade in and out. 

    I was able to get most of the page reactive!! I am very impressed, since it was a daunting task! 

    Wire frame was drawn in Figma, upon request. 

    I realized that the data was not connecting to the Movie.js app due to having data instead of props.movie, which movies is used int he app.js and not data!!!!


    Improvement

    I wanted to add a modal.

    I would like to have the cards and sizes more cohesive.

    I would like to make the entire application reactive to auto adjust when adjusting the size of the screen. 


 
What went well for your group? 

	The overall flow went well or dividing the task and merging it together..... 

What was your group's biggest struggle? 

	Git was the biggest struggle, due to the pushing and pulling, but we are much more comfortable with git!  

What was the most useful tool that your group relied on the most? 

	CSS and Google 

What was the most surprising aspect of working in a group/a thing (or things) you didnâ€™t anticipate? 
	I honestly did not think that everything on the website would look as nice as it does! 
	      I am shocked with how well and how easy all of the code was able to be combined with minimal errors to make the code work/function.  



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
